# TTT-TimeTrackingTable

**These templates are still work in progress. (Agile template finished)**

Excel worksheets which are great for time tracking in your PRE-Project. Specially tailored for HTL-Spengergasse students.

I recommend you to use the first model (1) in the third year and the second model (2) in your fourth year and for your diploma project (in case your client gives you a choice).

1. Basic Time Tracking Table
   - Useful for the waterfall method
   - Simplest model
2. Agile Time Tracking Table
   - Works great for agile methods like SCRUM
   - More complicated
   - Generates an EAV-diagram

You will find more explanations on how the models work inside the files in the 'Manual' sheet.

There won't be many updates to this repository, but you can propose changes to existing models or add new models through pull requests [[GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/es/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)].
Try not to use macros unless you make big changes.
